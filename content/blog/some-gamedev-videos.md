I have been meaning to record some playthrough videos of my two most recent gamedev.net 'Week of Awesome' competition entries for 2016 & 2017 and finally got around to it.

You can already find a [video of my 2014 entry 'Save My Toys'](/blog/save-my-toys-a-walkthrough)Â in an earlier blog entry.

The challenge was to make a game from scratch in a week. Four themes are announced, contestants must pick two of those and incorporate them into the game somehow.

I won 1st prize for two years running with these games:

2017 - Invasion Of The Liquid Snatchers
---------------------------------------

Themes I selected were 'Alien Invasion' and 'Chain Reaction'.

I also wrote about the [fluid rendering & simuation](/blog/fluid-rendering-with-box2d) for this game.

2016 - Gamut of Blob
--------------------

Themes selected were 'Evolution' and 'Shadows'. ([sourcecode](https://github.com/daveagill/GamutOfBlob))
