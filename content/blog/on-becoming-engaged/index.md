I am now engaged to my girlfriend-come-fiancÃ©e of 5 years!!

{{< thumbnail x300 "ring.jpg" "The engagement ring" >}}

We're very pleased!

I proposed on Thursday October 24th at Anglesey Abbey in their Dahlia garden and successfully managed to conceal the ring in its box for the whole trip until that moment - so it was total surprise to her! ðŸ˜„

Everybody always asks if I got down on one knee - and I did! Since it makes for a bit of a spectacle I waited until everybody else had gone away first so we could have our moment in private.

I bought the ring online. It's platinum with a Morganite central stone surrounded by small diamonds and sets of diamonds embedded in the band also. It's lovely to look at.
