First off I am delighted to have placed 5th in the competition overall!

Due to the great response I've had to the game, from other competitors and the judges I have decided to record a quick playthrough of my Week of Awesome II competition entry: Save My Toys.

The video quality is bit low but this shows the full extent of the game and the solutions I originally envisaged - although some levels have multiple solutions either by design or not quite intentionally.

Enjoy!
